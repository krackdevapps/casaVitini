/**
 * Certificate Manager Service API
 * Using the Certificate Manager Service, you can conveniently provision and manage SSL certificates with IONOS services and your internal connected resources. For the [Application Load Balancer](https://api.ionos.com/docs/cloud/v6/#Application-Load-Balancers-get-datacenters-datacenterId-applicationloadbalancers), you usually need a certificate to encrypt your HTTPS traffic.  The service provides the basic functions of uploading and deleting your certificates for this purpose.
